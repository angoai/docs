# My model plugin does not show up in the "Detector" list in the labeling editor

Ensure that the plugin you are trying to run is of the "[Model](../plugins/plugin-developer-documentation/model-plugins.md)_"_ type. "[Batch Model](../plugins/plugin-developer-documentation/batch-model-plugins.md)" plugins will not appear in the labeling editor. You can check your plugin's model from your project page -> Settings -> Plugins:
