# Audio Labeling Editor

Ango Hub provides a labeling editor with which audio files can be annotated.

This article will exclusively go over Ango Hub’s audio labeling interface. Features common to all labeling editors (audio, image, PDF, and text) are instead [explained here](./).

Starting from the left, the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (434).png" alt="" data-size="line"> _two arrows_ icon allows you to resize the audio waveform to fit. This can be useful, for example, if you have opened the [_Assets drawer_](./#assets-drawer-project-owner-and-reviewer-only) or the [_Instructions_](./#instructions) panel.

At the center, playback controls allow you to play, pause, and rewind/forward a couple of seconds.

The slider on the right allows you to set the playback volume.

### How to Annotate Audio <a href="#how-to-annotate-audio" id="how-to-annotate-audio"></a>

From the playback buttons on the bottom bar, start and stop playback of the audio file as necessary.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you get no sound, make sure that:

* Your system volume is on
* The volume slider on the bottom bar is not all the way to the left
* You have selected the right output device on your computer
{% endhint %}

From the _Tools_ section on the left sidebar, select an _Entity_ labeling tool, marked with an underlined _A_ icon.

Click on the waveform where you’d like the annotation to start. Keep the left mouse button pressed and drag until where you’d like the annotation to end. Release the left mouse button.

You can change the start and end points of the annotation by selecting it with left-click, then dragging on one of the ends. You can drag the entire annotation by, after selecting it, clicking and dragging from the middle of the label.

If the labeling tool has nested questions, right-click on the label and click on the menu that appears to see and answer the nested questions.

If classification questions are present, you may answer them from the _Questions_ panel on the left sidebar.
