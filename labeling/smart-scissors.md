2\. With the Smart Scissors tool selected, click on where you'd like to start your polygon. Then, without holding down the left mouse button, move the cursor around the general area where you'd like your polygon to wrap. Click the left mouse button to add anchors, and the right mouse button to remove the last anchor you have placed. When you are done, press "N" to close the polygon:
