### How to add a PDF tool to your project <a href="#how-to-add-a-pdf-tool-to-your-project" id="how-to-add-a-pdf-tool-to-your-project"></a>

From the project’s _Settings_ tab, enter the _Label Set_ section.

Click on _Add Category_. From the list that appears, click on _PDF_.

A new row will appear named _PDF_. Click on it to expand it.

Give your PDF tool a title and description.

Enable the _Required_ toggle if you want to force labelers to create a PDF label for each asset. When the toggle is disabled, labelers will be able to save and move to the next asset without creating the PDF label.

If you would like to ask labelers further questions, for example, if you want to show a further _radio_ after placing a PDF tool, click on _Add Classification_ and add a further question. [More on nested questions here](nested-classifications.md).

### How to Label with the PDF Tool <a href="#how-to-label-with-the-pdf-tool" id="how-to-label-with-the-pdf-tool"></a>

From the _Tools_ panel on the left sidebar, select a _PDF_ labeling tool, marked with an A enclosed in a square.
