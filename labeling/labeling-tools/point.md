### How to add a Point tool to your project <a href="#how-to-add-a-point-tool-to-your-project" id="how-to-add-a-point-tool-to-your-project"></a>

From the project’s _Settings_ tab, enter the _Label Set_ section.

Give your point tool a title and description.

Enable the _Required_ toggle if you want to force labelers to create a point. When the toggle is disabled, labelers will be able to save and move to the next asset without creating a point label on the asset.

If you would like to ask labelers further questions, for example, if you want to show a further _radio_ after drawing the point, click on _Add Classification_ and add a further question. [More on nested questions here](nested-classifications.md).

Click on the image where you’d like the point to be.
