# Rotated Bounding Box

The rotated bounding box labeling tool allows you to draw a box around an object or point of interest in an image, and to then rotate it.

Give your rotated bounding box tool a title.

Enable the _Required_ toggle if you want to force labelers to create a rotated bounding box for each asset. When the toggle is disabled, labelers will be able to save and move to the next asset without creating the rotated bounding box.

If you would like to ask labelers further questions, for example, if you want to show a further _radio_ after drawing the rotated bounding box, click on _Add Classification_ and add a further question. [More on nested questions here](nested-classifications.md).

You can change the angle of the box by clicking and dragging on the point located just outside the box.
