# Table

Project owners and managers can create tables to annotate assets on Ango Hub. Tables are perfect for creating a large number of relations between multiple labels, or for data input-type tasks.

## The Table Annotation Tool in Ango Hub

### How to Create a Table

To create a table, enter the _Label Set_ section of the _Settings_ tab.

Create a labeling tool that corresponds to a column in the table. For example, if you'd like to ask a single dropdown question in a column, create a [single dropdown](../classification-tools/single-dropdown.md) tool. After doing so, enable its _Column Field_ toggle. Repeat until you have created all columns.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only classification tools can be table columns.
{% endhint %}

If you would like the column content to be labels (objects) themselves, create an _Object_ tool and turn on its _Column Field_ toggle.

### How to Fill a Table

In the labeling editor, click on the plus button to the left side of the table to create a new row.

Click on an empty cell in the new row. According to the labeling tool type you have chosen, you will be prompted to fill in the cell.
