### Text Tool Options

**Schema ID**: The unique ID assigned to the tool.

**Title**: The name of your labeling tool.

**Required**: If you enable this toggle, labelers will be required to answer this field before saving.

**Column Field**: If you enable this toggle, a table will appear at the top of the labeling editor and this tool will become the title of one of the columns. For more on table labeling look [here](../relation-tools/table.md).

**Regex Validation**: If you enter a regular expression in this field (without the initial and final `\` slashes), labelers' answers to this field will have to match the regex being input before saving.

**Frame-specific**: If you enable this toggle, the answer to this classification will only be valid for one frame (in videos and multi-frame images/DICOMs) instead of the whole asset.

Once you have selected your options, click on _Save_ at the bottom to save your changes.
