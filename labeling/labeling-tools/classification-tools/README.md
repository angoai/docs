# Classification Tools

Ango Hub provides a number of tools with which labelers can classify the assets shown to them. They are:

* [Checkbox](checkbox.md)
* [Single Dropdown](single-dropdown.md)
* [Multiple Dropdown](multiple-dropdown.md)
* [Radio](radio.md)
* [Text](text.md)
* [Tree Dropdown](tree-dropdown.md)

Beyond classification tools, the platform also provides tools to place directly on assets, such as [bounding boxes](../bounding-box.md), [polygons](../polygon.md), etcetera. [A full list of labeling tools can be found here](../).
