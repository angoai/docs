### How to add a Multiple Dropdown tool to your project <a href="#how-to-add-a-multiple-dropdown-tool-to-your-project" id="how-to-add-a-multiple-dropdown-tool-to-your-project"></a>

From the projectâ€™s _Settings_ tab, enter the _Label Set_ section.

Click on _Add Category_. From the list that appears, click on _Multiple Dropdown_.

A new row will appear named _Single Dropdown_. Click on it to expand it.

Give your single dropdown tool a title and description. From the _Options_ text box, you can enter the answers. Press _Enter_ after entering each one.

Enable the _Required_ toggle if you want to force labelers to answer it. When the toggle is disabled, labelers will be able to save and move to the next asset without answering this question.

If you would like to ask labelers further questions, for example, if you want to show a Text tool when labelers select a particular answer, click on _Add Classification_ and add a further question. [More on nested questions here](../nested-classifications.md).

### Differences between Checkbox and Multiple Dropdown <a href="#differences-between-checkbox-and-multiple-dropdown" id="differences-between-checkbox-and-multiple-dropdown"></a>

The tool is functionally identical to the [Checkbox tool](checkbox.md), with the main difference being visual.

The major benefit of the checkbox tool over the dropdown tool is that it can be answered by a labeler with a fewer amount of clicks, instead of the having to first open the dropdown to answer. The downside of checkbox is that it cannot easily display large numbers of items.

When the number of possible answers is limited, we recommend choosing the checkbox tool. For questions with a significant amount of more answers, the dropdown tool is preferable.

### Differences between the Single and Multiple Dropdown tools <a href="#differences-between-the-single-and-multiple-dropdown-tools" id="differences-between-the-single-and-multiple-dropdown-tools"></a>

In [single dropdowns](single-dropdown.md), labelers can only select one answer. In multiple dropdowns, labelers can select more than one.
