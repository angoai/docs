### Properties of the Tree Dropdown Tool

* **Schema ID**: A unique ID assigned to all instances of labeling tools on Ango Hub. You can use it when [importing labels for pre-labeling](../../../data/importing-and-exporting-annotations/importing-annotations/).
* **Title**: The title of the labeling tool you are creating. This will show up both in the editor for labelers to see, as well as in the final export.
* **Required**: Toggle this to make is to that labelers have to answer this classification before saving.
* **Frame-specific**: For video assets, determine whether the answer to this classification apply to the whole video or to each individual frame only. Toggling will make it frame-specific.
* **Show Dropdown**: Normally, trees are shown embedded within the classification tool and are immediately, fully visible to annotators. Toggling this option will make it so that to see the tree, annotators will have to click on an area, and as a result of the click the tree will show as a "dropdown". This can especially be useful for larger trees.
