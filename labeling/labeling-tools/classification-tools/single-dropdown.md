# Single Dropdown

The single dropdown labeling tool allows you to ask labelers close-ended questions with one right answer.

### How to add a Single Dropdown tool to your project <a href="#how-to-add-a-single-dropdown-tool-to-your-project" id="how-to-add-a-single-dropdown-tool-to-your-project"></a>

From the project’s _Settings_ tab, enter the _Label Set_ section.

Click on _Add Category_. From the list that appears, click on _Single Dropdown_.

A new row will appear named _Single Dropdown_. Click on it to expand it.

Give your single dropdown tool a title and description. From the _Options_ text box, you can enter the answers. Press _Enter_ after entering each one.

Enable the _Required_ toggle if you want to force labelers to answer it. When the toggle is disabled, labelers will be able to save and move to the next asset without answering this question.

If you would like to ask labelers further questions, for example, if you want to show a Text tool when labelers answer _Other_, click on _Add Classification_ and add a further question. [More on nested questions here](../nested-classifications.md).

### Differences between Radio and Single Dropdown <a href="#differences-between-radio-and-single-dropdown" id="differences-between-radio-and-single-dropdown"></a>

The tool is functionally identical to the [Radio tool](radio.md), with the main difference being visual.

The major benefit of the radio tool over the dropdown tool is that it can be answered by a labeler with a single click, instead of the two required for dropdowns. The downside is that it cannot easily display large numbers of items. Here’s an example of how to ideally use radios and dropdowns:

When the number of possible answers is limited, we recommend choosing the Radio tool. For questions with a significant amount of more answers, the dropdown tool is preferable.

### Differences between the Single and Multiple Dropdown tools <a href="#differences-between-the-single-and-multiple-dropdown-tools" id="differences-between-the-single-and-multiple-dropdown-tools"></a>

In single dropdowns, labelers can only select one answer. In multiple dropdowns, labelers can select more than one.\
