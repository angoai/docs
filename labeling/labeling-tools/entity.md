### How to add an Entity tool to your project <a href="#how-to-add-an-entity-tool-to-your-project" id="how-to-add-an-entity-tool-to-your-project"></a>

From the project’s _Settings_ tab, enter the _Label Set_ section.

Click on _Add Category_. From the list that appears, click on _Entity_.

A new row will appear named _Entity_. Click on it to expand it.

Give your entity tool a title.

Enable the _Required_ toggle if you want to force labelers to place one. When the toggle is disabled, labelers will be able to save and move to the next asset without creating an entity.

If you would like to ask labelers further questions, for example, if you want to show a further _radio_ after placing the entity, click on _Add Classification_ and add a further question. [More on nested questions here](nested-classifications.md).

You can change the start and end points of the annotation by selecting it by clicking it, then by dragging on one of the ends. You can drag the entire annotation by selecting it, then clicking and dragging from the middle of the label.

#### Text <a href="#text" id="text"></a>

From the _Tools_ panel on the left sidebar, select an _Entity_ labeling tool, marked with an underlined _A_.

With the _Entity_ tool selected, click and drag on text to highlight the text you’d like to label.

To edit an annotation, select it by clicking on it, then hover over one of the ends until the cursor turns into an arrow. Drag the annotation until it covers the area you need:
