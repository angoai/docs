# Download only part of your export

Hub allows you to download a section of your export using filters. Here's how you can do it:

1. In your project, go to the _Tasks_ tab.

2. From the filters present above the task list, filter the task list until you are left with the tasks you wish to export.\
   For example, if you wished to only export tasks completed in less than 5 minutes, you would click on _Filter_, then on _Duration_, and pick _Less than 300 seconds:_
