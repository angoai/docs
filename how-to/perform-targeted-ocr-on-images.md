# Perform targeted OCR on images

You may perform targeted OCR on images by adding a [_Bounding Box_](../labeling/labeling-tools/bounding-box.md) __ tool to your project and enabling its _Targeted OCR_ toggle.

More information on the page for the [Bounding Box](../labeling/labeling-tools/bounding-box.md) labeling tool.
