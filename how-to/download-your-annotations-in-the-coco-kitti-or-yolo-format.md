If Hub warns you that you need an API key to add a plugin to your organization, navigate to your [Account page](https://hub.ango.ai/account), then to the _API_ tab and click on _Create New Key_. Once you've created the new key, go back to the _Plugin Directory_ and you will be able to add the desired plugin to your organization.

4. Navigate to the project where you'd like to get the export, then go to its _Settings_ tab.
5. From the _Plugins_ section, click _Open_ on the plugin we've just installed. A dialog will pop up:

6. Tweak the settings in the _Config JSON_ text area to your liking, then press on _Run_. You will receive a notification with a link to your converted export.

If the _Run_ button is not available, it means the plugin is offline. Plugin availability is on a best-effort basis. If a plugin you need is currently offline, please email us at info \[at] ango.ai and we will help.
