# Transfer project ontologies between projects

Ango Hub allows you to copy the project ontology from one project and paste it in another, by following the below steps:

1. Navigate to the project containing the ontology you wish to copy.
2.  Navigate to the _Settings_ tab, then the _Category Schema_ section.

3.  Click on the "code" button (1) on the right. A panel showing the project's ontology JSON will appear. Copy the JSON to your clipboard using the "copy" button (2).

4. Navigate to the project where you'd like to paste the ontology and follow the same steps, but instead of copying, paste the JSON you have just copied into the box.
5. Click on _Save_ at the bottom of the page.
