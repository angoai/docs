# Overview of Plugins in Ango Hub

Plugins allow you to extend the functionality of Ango Hub, such as allowing you to add new export formats, integrating your own ML model, and more.

## Developing Plugins

You can develop your own plugins and choose to use them just in your own organization, or to publish them to the Directory for everyone to use. [Documentation on creating plugins can be found here.](plugin-developer-documentation/)

You can develop plugins of five types, each with its own documentation page:

* [Export Plugins](plugin-developer-documentation/export-plugins.md)
* [Batch Model Plugins](plugin-developer-documentation/batch-model-plugins.md)
* [Model Plugins](plugin-developer-documentation/model-plugins.md)
* [File Explorer Plugins](plugin-developer-documentation/file-explorer-plugins.md)
* [Markdown Generator Plugins](plugin-developer-documentation/markdown-generator-plugins.md)

We also have a page detailing [how to deploy your plugin to the cloud](plugin-developer-documentation/deploy-your-plugin-to-the-cloud.md) to ensure maximum uptime.

## Installing Plugins

You can install plugins from our centralized plugin repository, the _Directory_, and quickly add them to your project. [More on the Directory here](installing-plugins.md).
