# Overview of Plugins in Ango Hub

Plugins allow you to extend the functionality of Ango Hub, such as allowing you to add new export formats, integrating your own ML model, and more.

## Developing Plugins

You can develop your own plugins and choose to use them just in your own organization, or to publish them to the Directory for everyone to use. [Documentation on creating plugins can be found here.](plugin-developer-documentation/)

You can develop plugins of four types, each with its own documentation page:

* [Export](plugin-developer-documentation/export-plugins.md)
* [Batch Model](plugin-developer-documentation/batch-model-plugins.md)
* [File Explorer](plugin-developer-documentation/file-explorer-plugins.md)
* [Markdown Generator](plugin-developer-documentation/markdown-generator-plugins.md)

We also have a page detailing [how to deploy your plugin to the cloud](plugin-developer-documentation/deploy-your-plugin-to-the-cloud.md) to ensure maximum uptime.

## Installing Plugins

You can install plugins from our centralized plugin repository, the _Directory_, and quickly add them to your project. [More on the Directory here](installing-plugins.md).

## Legacy Built-In Plugins

Ango Hub offers a number of plugins in an older format, allowing you to perform OCR on assets, plate recognition, DICOM anonymization and more. We call them "Legacy Plugins" and they will be slowly sunset as we develop our next generation plugin architecture.

[You may find information on legacy plugins here](broken-reference).
