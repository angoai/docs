# Installing Plugins

## Obtaining your API Key

In order to install plugins, you will need to have an API key associated with your account. To obtain one, please follow the steps [in this page](../how-to/get-your-api-key.md).

## Installing Plugins

Ango AI provides a centralized repository of plugins called the Directory. Anyone may upload to, and install plugins from the Directory.

The Plugin Directory is where you can find custom plugins created by other users, and add them to your own [organization](../core-concepts/organizations.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Unless specified otherwise, plugins in the Directory are not monitored by Ango AI. Run plugins added from the Directory at your own risk.
{% endhint %}

Click on _Plugins_ from the top navbar, then on _Organization Plugins_. Click on _Show Plugin Directory_.

The Directory will open, listing all plugins that have been marked as "Public" and "Listed," as well as  all "Listed" plugins from your own organization regardless of "Public" status:

Clicking on _Add_ below a plugin will instantly add it to your own organization.
