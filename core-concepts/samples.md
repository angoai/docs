# Samples

With samples, administrators, project managers, and reviewers can pick certain annotations to become available to all labelers to use as reference.

If you believe an annotation can be valuable to all labelers, so that they can use it as "manual" for next annotations, you can mark it as a sample, as well as optionally give it a name and a description. All labelers will be able to see the sample annotation and your remarks directly while labeling, without interrupting their workflow.

## Setting and Viewing Samples on Ango Hub

1. Click on the lightbulb icon on the top right of the screen.
2. Optionally, pick a title and a description for your sample.
