description: Setting up your labeling project's ontology on Ango Hub
---

# Label Sets (Ontologies)

A project’s label set (also known as _ontology_) is the list of labeling tools available in the project.

Ango Hub allows project owners to set the project’s ontology directly from the _Label Set_ section of the _Settings_ page.

The ontology created from this section is then reflected in the left sidebar of the labeling editor:

From the project’s _Settings_ tab, enter the _Label Set_ section.

Click on the blue _Add Category_ button and choose the labeling tool to add. Each tool has a slightly different setup process. [See here for a list of all labeling tools available in Ango Hub, and how to add them to your project.](../labeling/labeling-tools/)

For a guide on how to create nested classifications, [see here](../labeling/labeling-tools/nested-classifications.md).
