# Projects

Projects are the main way to organize and distribute labeling tasks in Ango Hub.

In projects, project owners and [managers](../labeling/managing-users-in-projects/#managers) can upload [assets](assets.md), add annotators, add [reviewers](reviewing.md), create label sets (annotation ontologies), export their results, and more. Everything done in Ango Hub is done within projects.

## Managing Projects in Ango Hub <a href="#creating-projects" id="creating-projects"></a>

### Creating Projects <a href="#creating-projects" id="creating-projects"></a>

From Ango Hub’s _Projects_ page, click on “Create Project” on the top right or the center.

You'll be presented with two options. If you pick _Import Sample Projects_ you'll be presented with a list of sample projects you can quickly import to check out the capabilities of the platform. If you'd rather start from scratch, pick _Create a New Project_.

A dialog will pop up asking to input the project's name and description. Click on _Create Project_ at the bottom to create your project.

### Pinning Projects <a href="#deleting-projects" id="deleting-projects"></a>

You may pin projects to the top of your project list for easy access.

{% hint style="info" %}
Pinning a project will only pin it for your specific user account.

Other members of your organization will not see your pin.
{% endhint %}

To pin a project, hover over the left side of the row of the project you'd like to pin. A pin icon will appear. Click on it to pin the project.

### Cloning Projects <a href="#deleting-projects" id="deleting-projects"></a>

You may clone a project to create a duplicate of it.

To clone a project, from the _Projects_ page, click on the three dots in the same row as the project you wish to clone and click on _Clone Project_.

A duplicate of the selected project will be added to your project list.

### Deleting Projects <a href="#deleting-projects" id="deleting-projects"></a>

To delete a project, from the _Projects_ page, click on the three dots in the same row as the project you wish to delete and click on _Delete_.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Deleting projects is an irreversible and destructive action. Once a project has been deleted, it cannot be recovered.

There is **no** "Trash" to which recently deleted projects go.
{% endhint %}
