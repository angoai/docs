# Stars

_Stars_ are Ango Hub's equivalent to a bookmarking system. Star labeling tasks you'd like to save to quickly reference later, and use stars the way you want to keep your labeling tasks organized and always within arm's reach.

## Using Stars in Ango Hub

### Starring a Task

Open the task you wish to star, and click on the black star icon on the top-right corner. When the star turns yellow, it means the task was starred successfully.
