# Reviewing

Reviewing is a key component in ensuring your labels are kept at the highest possible level of quality.

Reviewing is the act of looking at a labeling [task](tasks.md) again and confirming that it was done correctly, or to fix it if it wasn't done correctly. Only users with the role of [_Reviewer_](../labeling/managing-users-in-projects/#reviewer) or [_Manager_](../labeling/managing-users-in-projects/#managers) can perform reviews.

## How to review tasks (Reviewer or Manager roles only)

From your project's dashboard, click on _Start Reviewing_ on the top-right corner of the screen.

You will be shown the first unreviewed labeling task in the project.

From here, you can accept the labels as they are by clicking on _Accept,_ or you can reject the labeling task by clicking on _Reject_ in the lower left corner of the screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Accept_ and _Reject_ are flags attached to the particular task. Rejecting a task does not mean it will be sent to the review stage again.
{% endhint %}

If you choose instead to fix the labeling task yourself, make your modifications, then click on the _Fixed_ button that appears in place of the _Accept_ button.

After submitting your choice, you will be shown the next unreviewed task, until none are left.
