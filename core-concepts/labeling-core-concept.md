# Labeling

Labeling is the main action performed on Ango Hub.

Annotators open the [labeling editor](../labeling/labeling-editor-interface/), in which [assets](assets.md) are shown. They then select [labeling tools](../labeling/labeling-tools/) and place labels on assets. [See all supported file types on Ango Hub](../data/importing-assets/supported-asset-file-types.md).

## How to start labeling <a href="#how-to-start-labeling" id="how-to-start-labeling"></a>

From the projectâ€™s dashboard, click on the _Start Labeling_ button on the top right.

You will be shown the first available unlabeled asset in the labeling queue.

To annotate, select a labeling tool from the _Tools_ section in the left sidebar, then place the label on the asset. If there are no tools in the _Tools_ section, answer the questions in the _Questions_ section. ([More details on labeling tools](../labeling/labeling-tools/).)

Once you have finished labeling ([see here an overview of the labeling editor interface](../labeling/labeling-editor-interface/)) click on _Submit_ or _Save_. You will be shown the next unlabeled asset in the queue.
